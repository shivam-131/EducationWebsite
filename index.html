            <p class="sectionSubTag test-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionSubTag test-small">Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
                informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually
                structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
                regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
                such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
                alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a
                more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
                settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a
                formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether
                unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly
                informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can
                be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.

            <p class="sectionSubTag test-small">Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.
